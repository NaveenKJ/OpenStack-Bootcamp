# OpenStack Bootcamp
This is the code repository for [OpenStack Bootcamp](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-finance-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781787125698), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the book
This book uses Python as the computational tool. Since Python is free, any schools or organizations can download and use it. It is a powerful tool for quantitative finance, financial engineering programs, and quantitative master degree programs.

The second edition made several adjustments. First, it reorganizes the book according to various finance subjects. In other words, the first edition focuses more on Python while the second edition is truly trying to apply Python to finance.

The book starts with explaining topics exclusively related to Python. Then we see deal with critical parts of python language explaining concepts like Time Value of Money Stock and Bond Evaluations, Capital Asset Pricing Model , Multi-factor models, Time Series Analysis, Portfolio Theory, Options and Futures , Value at Risk, Monte Carlo Simulation , Credit Risk Analysis, Exotic Option, and Volatility, Implied volatility, ARCH and GARCH .

This book will help us to learn or review the basics of quantitative finance and apply Python to solve various problems such as estimate IBMâ€™s market risk, run a Fama-French 3-factor, 5-factor or Fama-French-Carhart 4 factor models, estimate VaR of a 5-stock portfolio , estimate the optimal portfolio and construct their efficient frontier for a 20 stock portfolio with real-world stocks, with Monte Carlo Simulation. Later, we will also learn how to replicate famous Black-Scholes-Merton option models and how to price some exotic options such as average price call option.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 06.

The code will look like the following:
   
        openstack --version
         #Returns the version number for Openstack command-line client.
        openstack service list
         # Will return the list of servers configured as part of the Openstack cluster.
        openstack --help
         #The above command will output the long listing available Openstack CLI.

## Software requirements:
You can benefit greatly by having a system running VirtualBox (or any of its alternatives) and a virtual machine running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The commands and resources discussed in this book are best learned when you can execute them on the test system. Familiarity with the Linux command-line and experience with Linux system administration is expected.
Requirements:
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS operating system
* 6 GB RAM
* 40 GB disk space
* 2 vCPUs
* 2 NIC (Adapter 1 - NAT network and Adapter 2 - host-only network)

### Note:
There are no codes for chapter 02, 03, 04, 05, 07, and 10.
